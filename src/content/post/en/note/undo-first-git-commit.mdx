If you made a mistake with the first Git commit or want to reset the project, you can easily undo it using the methods below.

---

## How to Undo the Commit

**1. Delete the First Commit**

If this is the only commit in your repository, you can safely delete it with the following command:

```shell
git update-ref -d HEAD
```

- This command deletes the first commit and leaves the changes in the working directory.

**2. Undo Commit While Keeping Changes**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- This will undo the commit but keep the changes in the staging area.

## Notes

- **Backup is essential**: Always back up before performing destructive operations.
- **Be cautious when collaborating**: Undoing a commit that has been pushed to a remote repository can cause synchronization issues for your team, so proceed with caution.
