As a developer, you might need to use both personal and work GitHub accounts on the same computer. By default, Git uses a global user configuration, but with a few tweaks, you can easily manage multiple accounts. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use multiple GitHub accounts on a single machine.

---

## 1. Generate and Add SSH Keys

Each account requires a separate SSH key.

**Generate SSH Keys**

```shell
# Generate SSH key for personal account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "personal@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Generate SSH key for work account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "work@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

**Add Keys to the SSH Agent**

```shell
# Start the SSH agent and add the keys
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

**Add SSH Keys to GitHub**

1. Display the public keys:

```shell
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal.pub
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work.pub
```

2. Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys and add the respective public keys for each account.

---

## 2. Configure the SSH Config File

Modify the SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) to specify which key to use for each account.

**Edit the SSH Config File**

```shell
# Open the SSH config file
code ~/.ssh/config
```

**Add Configuration**

```shell
# Personal account
Host github.com-personal
    HostName github.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Work account
Host github.com-work
    HostName github.com
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

This configuration uses the aliases `github-personal` and `github-work` to distinguish between accounts.

---

## 3. Separate Git Configurations

To specify which account to use for a project, configure the local Git settings for that directory.

**Check Global Git Settings**

```shell
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

**Set Local Git Settings**

Run the following commands in your project directory to set the local account:

Personal Project:

```shell
cd ~/personal-project
git config user.name "Personal Name"
git config user.email "personal@example.com"
```

Work Project:

```shell
cd ~/work-project
git config user.name "Work Name"
git config user.email "work@example.com"
```

---

## 4. Use SSH Aliases for Cloning

When cloning repositories, use the SSH aliases defined in the SSH config file.

Clone a Personal Account Repository:

```shell
git clone git@github-personal:username/repository.git
```

Clone a Work Account Repository:

```shell
git clone git@github-work:username/repository.git
```

---

## 5. Verify and Test

**Check Current Account**

Git uses the local configuration for commits. Check the current account with:

```shell
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

**Test SSH Connections**

```shell
ssh -T git@github-personal
ssh -T git@github-work
```

---

## Conclusion

With this setup, you can efficiently use multiple GitHub accounts on a single computer. This method is particularly useful for separating personal and work projects or collaborating with multiple organizations. Adjust your SSH keys and Git configurations as needed to manage even more complex workflows.
